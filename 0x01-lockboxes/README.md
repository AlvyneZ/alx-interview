# Lockboxes
## Author: AlvyneZ
This directory contains a solution to the lockbox problem:  
- n locked boxes numbered sequentially from 0 to (n-1) are to be opened.
- Each box contains keys to boxes. A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
- The first box (index 0) is already opened.
- The task is to find out if all the boxes can be opened.
