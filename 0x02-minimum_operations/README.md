# Minimum Operations
## Author: AlvyneZ
This directory contains a solution to the Minimum Operations problem:  
- In a text file, there is a single character H.
- Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste.
- Given a number n, calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

### Solution
The minimum operations is given by the sum of n's prime factors.  
The problem thus degenerates into a prime factorization problem.
