This directory contains a solution to the N queens problem

### Problem
The n-queens problem is to place n queens (where n > 0) on an n-by-n chessboard
 so that no queen is threatened by another one. According to the rules of chess, this
 is equivalent to the requirement that no two queens be on the same row or the same
 column or on a common diagonal.  
All possible solutions are required.
