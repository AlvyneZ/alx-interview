# Log Parsing
## Author: AlvyneZ
This directory contains a solution to the ALX Log Parsing problem:  
- Logs are to be read from stdin line by line
- Log format: ```<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>```
- Statistics are to be printed after every 10 input lines and/or keyboard interruption (Ctrl+C):
  - **Total file size (cumulative sum of file sizes for each log):** ```File size: <total size>```
  - **Count of status codes received:** ```<status code>: <number>```
